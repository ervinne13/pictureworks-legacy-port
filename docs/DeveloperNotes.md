# Developer Notes

## "Deviations" From the Requirements

The original application had the comments and user combined. This resulted in it updating a "comments" column that contains the user comments separated by new lines.

In our implementation, we'll write it properly with separate tables since the requirement just stated that we need the same output for an input, it didn't really tell us that we retain this practice.


## Frontend

Okay, I was overwhelmed here. It's been a while since I last touched Laravel and the frontend is very different now. Let's stick to blade for now then ask the employer whether the Senior Laravel Developer role is fullstack.
